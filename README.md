Let's see if you're a risk taker.

THE RULES

Each card numbered from 1 to 9 has its nominal value (equal to the number on the card).
You're against the dealer, who represents the casino, and not against each other.
You're goal is to beat the dealer by getting a total of points higher than him.

THE GAME

You start with the landing page in HTML, you click on play. 
The gameboard should appear. You start with two cards.
Then you have to choose between stand with your cards or add another one. 

If you choose to add another, and the value of your card is more than 21, you lose.
If the value is 21, you win.

If you choose to stand, another card will be given, just to see if you did the right choice. 
If the new card push you beyond 21, you have win. If the new card don't push you over 21, you lose because you didn't make the right choice.
