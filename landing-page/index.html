        <h4>THE RULES</h4>
        <p> 
          Each card numbered from 2 to 10 has its nominal value (equal to the number on the card). <br>
          Jacks, Queens and Kings have a value of 10 points. <br>
          The Ace is worth 1 point or 11 points, as you want. <br> <br>
          <strong> Blackjack is made up of an Ace and a Jack,Queen or King.</strong>
        </p>
        <p> 
          You're against the dealer, who represents the casino, and not against each other.
          You're goal is to beat the dealer by getting a total of points higher than him or by seeing him exceed 21.          
        </p>
        <p>
          You start with 100 coins. <br>
          At the beginning of each round, you have to chose how many coins you want to bet. <br>
          If you make a BlackJack you get 3 for 2 times your bet. <br>
          If you win without a Blackjack, you double your bet. <br>
          If you lose, your bet goes to the bank. <br> <br>
          <strong> Are you ready ? </strong> <br>
